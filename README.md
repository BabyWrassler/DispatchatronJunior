When the county fire department dispatches a real fire truck, we launch a toy truck onto the train table in our living room.

This device uses an Arduino to monitor a light sensor positioned on the status light of a radio receiver tuned to the dispatch frequency of the local fire department. The Arduino controls a hacked Micro Chargers car launcher that dispatches a Micro Chargers car painted to look like a fire truck and with an added flashing LED.
